# FHIR

There are multiple vendors developing EHR applications for health institues and FHIR is a common API those vendors share. Epic (30%), Cerner(25%), Meditech (15%) and Allscripts (5%) cover most of market. The question is whether FHIR API in the same across those vendors (probably now) and how to integrate with them at once?
