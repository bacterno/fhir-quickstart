# FHIR

There are multiple vendors developing EHR applications for health institues and FHIR is a common API those vendors share. Epic (30%), Cerner(25%), Meditech (15%), CPSI (9%), Allscripts (5%) and Medhost (3%) cover most of market. The questions this research aimed to answer are 
- Is there a comprehensive list of Hospitals and APIs available across those vendors?
- Can user-facing app get full data spectrum from FHIR API, or one needs to work with a hospital?
- Whether FHIR API in the same across those vendors or not, what differences are, and how to integrate with all of them at once?

Epic has list of end-points availalble over here - https://open.epic.com/MyApps/Endpoints
Cerner seems to hide them and work as a service, or proxing stand-alone instances (After observing https://1up.health/fhir-endpoint-directory/1 end-points), I asked community - https://groups.google.com/g/cerner-fhir-developers/c/tEyTJqaWYTs
